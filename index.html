	<section id="Details"><p>Honey and Bunny are twin cats. They love to team up and play pranks on everyone else. They are also protective of each other. Bunny is the smarter cat of the two, while Honey is always clueless and naive. As Honey is called a fool, he does not know he's good-bad and is the bravest among the four heroes. Bunny plays the main role to save others.</p></section>
