He has a catchphrase: "Koee shak" (meaning "any doubt"). He also gets angry when his friends are in great trouble or danger. In some episodes, a big Eagle tries to catch and eat him but fails every time. As he can fly, he is the fastest among the four heroes.
Honey and Bunny - Honey and Bunny are twin cats. They love to team up and play pranks on everyone else. They are also protective of each other.

Bunny plays the main role to save others.

While the other pets in the house are up to mischief, he tries to find a way out and often ends up landing into trouble himself. He loves Honey, Bunny, and Popat dearly.
